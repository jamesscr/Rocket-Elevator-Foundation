Every pointer marks the localization of every buildings and hovering the following informations: address, number of floors, clients name, number of batteries, number of columns, number of elevators and the technician’s full name.

Everytime you change the address or create a new one, if you have enough information (ex: number and street, city) every other informations get updated.


 ## Twilio
The API triggers only once the status of an elevator is changed to "Intervention", then the client will get a text message on his phone.
